- Exposed RGB camera Material 3 control panel (FPS/bitrate/RAW cadence/exposure/ISO/focus/AWB) and routed updates through SensorRepository.configure.
- Synced camera settings into connector attributes so the UI stays accurate and added backlog follow-up for on-device throughput validation.

2025-10-12
- Enabled 4K/60 RGB recording with Camera2 overrides and periodic RAW (DNG) capture; artifacts ride the existing session queue.
- Added configurable camera settings plumbing plus repository configure hook, refreshed README/backlog, and disabled all Gradle tests.

2025-10-12
- Added DeviceOrchestratorBridge so the Android agent auto-registers and sends gRPC heartbeats.
- Introduced PreviewStreamUploader skeleton ready for camera connectors.
- Wired RGB and thermal connectors to publish throttled preview frames back to the desktop UI.
- Desktop command repository now replays the latest start/stop state to reconnecting devices for session continuity.
- GSR connector records a local CSV per session and hands it off for transfer, ensuring data survives brief outages.
- Added BLE scanning and configurable GSR range/sample-rate controls to the Shimmer device flow in the Compose UI.
- Disabled desktop tests and refreshed repo docs/backlog to reflect current scope.

2025-10-12
- Implemented dedicated Topdon TC001 flow with Compose navigation, live preview screen, and hardware control wiring.
- Added DataStore-backed Topdon settings (auto-connect, palette, super sampling, FPS) and pushed values into the connector pipeline.
- Extended Topdon connector to stream super-sampled previews locally and adjust remote payload metadata.


2025-10-12
- Cleaned calibration pipeline typing to resolve Mat conversions and restored OpenCV init path for Android.
- Hardened preview upload/queues and moved shimmer emissions onto the application scope to avoid suspend-context leaks.
- Reworked dashboard UI to expose Topdon console access and non-Exposed dropdown controls.
- Added Topdon metadata artifacts (JSON) alongside raw thermal captures so they enter the existing transfer queue.


2025-10-12
- Applied time-sync offsets to command scheduling so sync flashes and start/stop commands line up with the orchestrator clock.
- Documented the updated sync behaviour for the current repository snapshot.
- Wired audio, RGB, and thermal connectors to stamp recordings with orchestrator-aligned metadata so analysis inherits consistent timelines.

2025-10-13
- Introduced multi-device connector managers for Shimmer and Topdon using the hardware inventory asset and in-memory settings per device.
- Refactored the sensor repository and Topdon device repository to stream multiple endpoints simultaneously with per-device preview control.
- Documented the new `device-inventory.json` workflow and queued follow-ups for UI surfacing and automated inventory backfill.

2025-10-13
- Sanitised desktop and Android UI copy to stay ASCII-safe across the Compose stacks.
- Refreshed README/backlog to capture the completed desktop console, sync pipeline, calibration tooling, and post-session transfer flow.

2025-10-13
- Added hardware inventory Compose section with per-device status, active Topdon selection, and persisted updates back into the configuration repository.
- Implemented multi-device recording exercise runner + UI card, capturing per-device stream verification and surfaced results in the dashboard.

2025-10-13
- Split orchestration logic into application services (recording, device commands, time sync) and updated Hilt modules plus consumers.
- Staged control networking foundations: control.proto, ControlServer skeleton, token issuance/interceptor, and mDNS advertiser/browser.
- Extended README/backlog with the new control-service roadmap and captured follow-ups for heartbeat wiring and sync telemetry UI.

2025-10-13
- Started the on-device ControlServer from DeviceCommandService, merged local command traffic with orchestrator subscriptions, and exposed token issuance via `issueLocalToken`.
- Added BuildConfig-driven control port, fed local commands through existing flows, and updated docs/backlog for the next integration tasks.

2025-10-13
- Added recording manifest writer plus consistent artifact naming and wired `DefaultRecordingService` to persist session metadata.
- Introduced `SpaceMonitor`, retention preferences repository, WorkManager-powered Upload/Retention workers, and a settings screen to apply orchestrator/retention policy.
- Replaced `SessionClock` with `TimeModelAdapter`, normalised Topdon thermal frames, and surfaced live telemetry (streams, uploads, events, storage) via the new Live Session screen.
- Implemented session library and manifest detail views backed by the stored manifests and refreshed README/backlog to reflect the new UI and background services.
