# Repository Gap Analysis and Unfinished Work

**Analysis Date:** 2025-10-13  
**Analysis Time:** 19:57 UTC  
**Repository:** Buccancs Multi-Modal Data Acquisition System

---

## Executive Summary

The repository represents a substantial implementation of a multi-sensor data acquisition system with Android capture
agents and desktop orchestration. Core functionality for recording, synchronization, and data transfer is largely in
place, but significant gaps remain in testing, PC-side implementation, documentation, and production readiness.

**Implementation Status:** ~70% complete

- Android Client: ~85% complete
- Desktop Orchestrator: ~50% complete
- Protocol/Communication: ~80% complete
- Testing Infrastructure: ~10% complete
- Documentation: ~40% complete

## CRITICAL GAPS (Block Production Use)

### 1. Desktop/PC Orchestrator Implementation (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Status:** Partially implemented, missing core orchestration logic

**Missing Components:**

- **Data Ingestion Pipeline**: PC does not fully receive and aggregate uploaded artifacts from Android devices
- **Session Storage Management**: Desktop-side session folder creation and file organization incomplete
- **Time Server Implementation**: Production-grade NTP-like time synchronization server not implemented
- **Device Discovery Service**: mDNS browser and automatic device pairing incomplete on PC
- **Command Broadcast System**: Multi-device command coordination needs validation
- **Preview Stream Receiver**: Desktop preview tile rendering stubbed
- **File Transfer Reception**: gRPC file upload server incomplete

**Current State:**

- gRPC server stubs exist (`desktop/src/main/kotlin/com/buccancs/desktop/data/grpc/`)
- Desktop UI displays mock/empty state
- No end-to-end validation with actual Android devices

**Impact:** Cannot run actual experiments without PC orchestrator

**Remediation Required:**

```

## CONCLUSION

The Buccancs system has a **solid architectural foundation** with most Android client functionality implemented and
working in simulation. However, **significant gaps remain in the PC orchestrator, integration testing, and validation**
of core requirements.

**Key Strengths:**

- Well-structured modular architecture (MVVM, Hilt, clean separation)
- Comprehensive requirements documentation
- Android client extensively implemented
- Good instrumentation and logging
- External SDK integration (Shimmer, Topdon) present

**Key Weaknesses:**

- Desktop orchestrator only ~50% complete
- Zero integration testing or hardware validation
- Critical NFRs (time sync, performance) unmeasured
- Security implementation incomplete
- Thesis evaluation chapter lacks real data

**Viability for Thesis Submission:**

- Current state: **Not ready** (significant implementation and testing gaps)
- With focused effort: **Achievable in 14-20 weeks** following prioritized roadmap
- Minimum viable submission: Requires completion of Phase 1-2 + basic Phase 5

**Recommended Approach:**
Focus on closing critical gaps (desktop orchestrator, testing, hardware validation) before polishing secondary features.
Prioritize getting real experimental data for thesis evaluation chapter over feature completeness.
