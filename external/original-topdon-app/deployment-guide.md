## Build Instructions

### Debug Build

```bash
cd external/original-topdon-app

# Clean build
./gradlew clean

# Build debug APK
./gradlew :app:assembleDevDebug

# Output: app/build/outputs/apk/dev/debug/TopInfrared-*.apk
```

### Release Build

```bash
# Build release APK (unsigned)
./gradlew :app:assembleDevRelease

# Output: app/build/outputs/apk/dev/release/TopInfrared-*.apk
```

### Install on Device

```bash
# Install debug build
./gradlew :app:installDevDebug

# Or use adb directly
adb install app/build/outputs/apk/dev/debug/TopInfrared-*.apk
```

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run unit tests
./gradlew :app:testDevDebugUnitTest
```

### UI Tests (Compose)

```bash
# Run instrumentation tests
./gradlew :app:connectedDevDebugAndroidTest

# Or run specific test
adb shell am instrument -w -e class com.topdon.tc001.ui.MainScreenTest \
    com.csl.irCamera.test/androidx.test.runner.AndroidJUnitRunner
```

## Migration-Specific Checks

### What Changed

1. **MainActivity** → MainActivityCompose (Compose)
2. **XML Layouts** → Composable functions
3. **ViewPager2** → Bottom NavigationBar
4. **Fragments** → Composable screens
5. **Kotlin synthetics** → Compose state

### What Stayed Same

- ARouter navigation (for thermal screens)
- WebSocket communication
- Topdon SDK integration
- USB/Bluetooth hardware
- Permissions system
- Data storage

### Known Limitations

- Thermal camera screens still use original activities (intentional)
- WebSocket integration minimal testing
- Deep linking not fully tested
- Some ARouter routes preserved

## Performance Monitoring

### Metrics to Track

```bash
# APK size
ls -lh app/build/outputs/apk/dev/debug/*.apk

# Method count
./gradlew :app:assembleDevDebug
# Check build output for method count

# Build time
time ./gradlew :app:assembleDevDebug --no-daemon
```

### Compose Metrics

- Recomposition count (use Layout Inspector)
- Skipped compositions
- Frame rate (use GPU profiling)

## Rollback Plan

### If Issues Found

1. **Critical bugs:** Revert to the previous XML implementation of
   `app/src/main/java/com/topdon/tc001/MainActivity.kt` using your version-control history.

2. **Performance issues:** Profile and optimize
    - Use Compose Compiler Reports
    - Check recomposition hotspots
    - Optimize heavy composables

3. **Compatibility issues:** Test specific Android versions
    - Min SDK 24 (Android 7.0)
    - Target SDK 34 (Android 14)

## Post-Deployment

### Monitor

- Crash reports
- User feedback
- Performance metrics
- Battery usage
- Memory consumption

### Next Steps

1. Gather user feedback
2. Monitor crash analytics
3. Performance optimization if needed
4. Complete ARouter migration
5. Add more UI tests

## Troubleshooting

### Build Issues

**Problem:** Compose compiler error

```
Solution: Check kotlinCompilerExtensionVersion matches Compose BOM
```

**Problem:** Dependency conflicts

```
Solution: Check for duplicate dependencies, exclude as needed
```

### Runtime Issues

**Problem:** Compose not rendering

```
Solution: Ensure setContent called in onCreate
Check Theme wraps content
```

**Problem:** Navigation not working

```
Solution: Verify NavHost setup
Check route definitions
Ensure NavController passed correctly
```

**Problem:** Images not loading

```
Solution: Check Coil configuration
Verify permissions granted
Check image paths
```
