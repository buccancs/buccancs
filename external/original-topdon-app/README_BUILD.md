## Key Changes

### LMS SDK Stubs

The
proprietary
LMS
SDK
has
been
replaced
with
functional
stubs:

*
*Location:
**
`libapp/src/main/java/com/topdon/lms/sdk/`

All
SDK
functionality
is
stubbed
but
compiles
successfully.
See
LMS_SDK_STUB_GUIDE.md
for
complete
API.

### Java Version

*
*Required:
**
Java
21 (
LTS)

```bash
# Windows
set JAVA_HOME=C:\Program Files\Java\jdk-21

# Linux/Mac
export JAVA_HOME=/path/to/jdk-21
```

### Deprecated Code

69
files
using
`kotlinx.android.synthetic.*`
have
been
commented
out.
These
need
View
Binding
migration
for
full
functionality.

---

## Troubleshooting

*
*Build
fails
with
cache
errors:
**

```bash
./gradlew --stop
./gradlew clean
```

*
*Out
of
memory:
**
Increase
in
`gradle.properties`:

```properties
org.gradle.jvmargs=-Xmx6144m
```

*
*Wrong
Java
version:
**

```bash
java -version  # Must show 21.x
```
