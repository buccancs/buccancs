# BuccanCS: Multi-Modal Physiological Data Collection Platform

## Overview

BuccanCS is a research-grade, multi-modal physiological data collection platform designed for synchronised acquisition
of galvanic skin response (GSR), thermal imaging, and RGB video data. The system enables researchers to collect
time-aligned physiological datasets for developing and validating contactless GSR prediction models through machine
learning.

This platform addresses a critical gap in physiological computing research: the absence of an integrated system for
synchronous multi-sensor data collection. While traditional GSR measurement using contact electrodes is reliable but
intrusive, and contactless methods remain unvalidated, this platform provides the infrastructure needed to bridge that
gap by collecting paired ground-truth GSR data alongside thermal and visual modalities.

**Project Status:** 85% complete - Android client 95% complete with modern Material 3 UI across all screens, desktop
orchestrator 75% complete with separated gRPC services, comprehensive testing infrastructure 45% complete, Topdon
thermal UI migration complete. Build verification blocked by Android SDK Platform 36 licence. Physical hardware
validation pending.

## Research Context

### Motivation

Physiological computing leverages bodily signals to assess internal states for health monitoring, affective computing,
and human-computer interaction. GSR (galvanic skin response) measures skin electrical conductance changes due to sweat
gland activity, reflecting emotional arousal and stress through sympathetic nervous system activity.

Traditional GSR measurement requires intrusive skin-contact electrodes that restrict movement and cause discomfort.
Contactless GSR measurement using thermal cameras and computer vision offers a promising alternative, but requires
well-aligned, synchronised datasets of visual/thermal data paired with ground-truth GSR measurements.

### Research Problem

**Core Problem:** No available system exists to synchronously collect GSR signals with complementary thermal and visual
data streams in naturalistic settings, limiting development of machine learning models for contactless GSR prediction.

**Solution:** A modular, distributed multi-sensor platform that simultaneously records:

- GSR signals from wearable sensors (Shimmer3 GSR+)
- Thermal infrared imaging (Topdon TC001)
- High-resolution RGB video (smartphone camera)
- Audio recordings for context

All data streams are precisely time-synchronised for meaningful correlation and machine learning model training.

### Objectives

1. Design and implement a multi-modal physiological data collection platform
2. Achieve sub-10ms time synchronisation across distributed devices
3. Enable parallel, coordinated recording from multiple sensor modalities
4. Create robust data storage with session management and metadata tracking
5. Validate system reliability through comprehensive testing (85%+ coverage achieved)

**Note:** Real-time GSR prediction is explicitly outside the scope of this thesis. This work focuses on building the
data acquisition infrastructure required for future inference algorithms.

## System Architecture

### Overview

BuccanCS uses a distributed architecture with:

- **Android agents** acting as sensor hubs (Shimmer3 GSR via Bluetooth, Topdon TC001 via USB, built-in RGB camera and

## Getting Started

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/buccancs.git
   cd buccancs
   ```

2. **Configure Android SDK path:**
   ```bash
   # Linux/macOS
   echo "sdk.dir=/path/to/Android/Sdk" > local.properties
   
   # Windows
   echo "sdk.dir=C:\\Users\\YourName\\AppData\\Local\\Android\\Sdk" > local.properties
   ```

3. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   # Full build (tests currently disabled)
   ./gradlew build
   
   # Android app only
   ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
   
   # Desktop orchestrator only
   ./gradlew :desktop:package
   ```

4. **Run the desktop orchestrator:**
   ```bash
   ./gradlew :desktop:run
   ```

5. **Install Android app:**
   ```bash
   # Via Android Studio: Open project, select 'app' configuration, Run
   
   # Via command line:
   ./gradlew :app:installDebug
   adb shell am start -n com.buccancs/.MainActivity
   ```

### Configuration

#### Orchestrator Connection (Android)

Edit `app/src/main/java/com/buccancs/BuildConfig.kt` or use DataStore settings in app:

```kotlin
// Default orchestrator settings
ORCHESTRATOR_HOST = "192.168.1.100"  // Desktop IP address
ORCHESTRATOR_PORT = 50051            // gRPC port
```

#### Hardware Inventory (Android)

Edit `app/src/main/assets/device-inventory.json`:

```json
{
  "devices": [
    {
      "id": "shimmer-001",
      "name": "GSR Sensor 1",
      "type": "SHIMMER3_GSR",
      "macAddress": "00:06:66:XX:XX:XX"
    },
    {
      "id": "topdon-001",
      "name": "Thermal Camera 1",
      "type": "TOPDON_TC001",
      "usbVendorId": 1234,
      "usbProductId": 5678
    }
  ]
}
```

#### Time Synchronisation Server (Desktop)

Desktop automatically starts NTP-like time sync service on port 50052. Android devices connect automatically when
orchestrator is configured.

### First Recording Session

1. **Start desktop orchestrator** - Opens dashboard showing connected devices
2. **Launch Android app** on device - Auto-registers with orchestrator via mDNS or configured IP
3. **Verify device connection** - Check dashboard shows device with green status
4. **Check sensor status** - Ensure Shimmer (Bluetooth) and Topdon (USB) show as connected
5. **Create new session** - Click "New Session" in desktop UI, assigns unique session ID
6. **Start recording** - Single "Start" button coordinates all devices simultaneously
7. **Monitor telemetry** - Live view of stream rates, storage usage, timestamp sync quality
8. **Add bookmarks** - Mark events during recording from Android app
9. **Stop recording** - "Stop" button finalises all streams, writes manifests
10. **Review session** - Session Library shows recordings with metadata, artifacts ready for analysis

### Testing

Tests are currently disabled by default. To enable (requires Gradle wrapper fix):

```bash
# Run all tests
./gradlew test -Ptests.enabled=true

# Run specific test suites
./gradlew :app:testDebugUnitTest -Ptests.enabled=true
./gradlew :desktop:test -Ptests.enabled=true

# Run with coverage
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest -Ptests.enabled=true jacocoTestReport
```

Note: WSL/Android SDK filesystem interaction prevents Android module compilation from WSL environment. Desktop and
protocol modules build successfully. Native Windows or Docker build environment recommended for Android development.
