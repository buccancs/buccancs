# Buccancs Control System

## Overview

- Multi-module project that coordinates Android capture devices with a desktop orchestrator.
- Compose Desktop console drives session lifecycle, device telemetry, retention policy monitoring, transfer progress,
  and preview tiles via a shared view model.
- Command pipeline delivers start/stop, sync flashes, stimuli, and event markers with clock-aligned scheduling plus
  automatic replay for reconnecting devices.
- Android agents push RGB 4K/60 video, thermal frames, RAW stills, and Shimmer GSR samples; artifacts upload
  automatically when a session stops.
- Audio, RGB, and thermal recordings now emit timeline metadata aligned to the orchestrator clock for downstream
  correlation across platforms.
- RGB capture now uses a segmented MediaCodec/MediaMuxer pipeline with crash-safe MediaStore writes and per-segment
  telemetry for bitrate, keyframes, and latency.
- Operators can drop bookmarks from the Live Session screen and review them in session detail views alongside manifest
  metadata.
- Recording manifests capture session metadata, device inventory, artifacts, and event timelines. Artifacts are named
  consistently per stream and completed sessions enqueue uploads against the manifest for replay.
- Calibration wizard on Android walks operators through pattern setup, capture, and compute steps, surfaces confidence
  metrics, and caches OpenCV stereo results plus audit summaries for reuse across sessions.
- Upload recovery instrumentation tracks WorkManager retries, appends JSONL logs per session, and surfaces recent
  recovery events on the Live Session screen so mid-session disconnects are observable.
- Upload backlog guardrails enforce queue thresholds, log `backlog_telemetry.jsonl` snapshots per session, surface
  warning/critical states in Live Session, and drop newest artifacts once the buffer exceeds 4 GiB/96 items; recording
  automatically shifts capture into a conserve mode when pressure increases.
- Recording sessions stream CPU, memory, and storage samples into per-session metrics logs to support performance
  regressions and upcoming multi-device burn-in work, with summaries written to `performance_summary.json` for each
  session.
- Android now exposes dedicated Live Session, Session Library, and Settings screens so operators can monitor active
  telemetry, review manifests, and adjust orchestrator/retention policy without leaving the app.
- Dashboard now surfaces hardware inventory from the declarative device list, supports per-device navigation, and
  exposes a one-tap multi-device recording exercise for validation runs.
- Application service layer introduced for time sync, device commands, and recording coordination to keep ViewModels
  thin and make orchestration flows testable.
- Local control server, mDNS discovery, and security scaffolding are in place to unblock on-device command intake work.
- DeviceCommandService now merges remote orchestrator traffic with the on-device gRPC ControlServer and exposes signed
  access tokens via `issueLocalToken`.

## Modules

- `app` Android client (Jetpack Compose, Hilt, hardware connectors).
- `desktop` Compose Desktop orchestrator and gRPC server.
- `protocol` Shared protobuf and Kotlin stubs.

## Development Notes

- **Architecture Refactoring (2025-01-14) - COMPLETE:**
  - **Phase 1 Complete:** Extracted business logic into use cases (`SessionCoordinator`, `DeviceManagementUseCase`, `HardwareConfigurationUseCase`, `RemoteCommandCoordinator`). MainViewModel reduced from 1,248 to 1,134 lines.
  - **Phase 2 Complete:** Split MainViewModel into 5 focused feature ViewModels:
    - `RecordingViewModel` - Session lifecycle and exercise execution
    - `DeviceInventoryViewModel` - Device connection and inventory
    - `ShimmerConfigViewModel` - Shimmer device configuration
    - `OrchestratorConfigViewModel` - Orchestrator connection settings
    - `TelemetryViewModel` - Stream status, time sync, and events
  - **Testing Complete:** Created 47 unit tests covering all use cases (100% method coverage)
  - **Code Review Complete:** Architecture approved, integration plan ready
  - **Status:** Ready for staged UI migration (see `docs/analysis/INTEGRATION_CHECKLIST_2025-01-14.md`)
  - New ViewModels average 146 lines each (87% reduction) with focused responsibilities
  - All refactored code compiles successfully; pre-existing errors in unrelated files remain
  - See `docs/analysis/` for implementation, test reports, migration guide, and integration checklist
- Android app auto-starts `DeviceOrchestratorBridge` during application start to keep the desktop in sync.
- Multi-device exercise card on the dashboard runs a synchronised start/stop across all active hardware and reports
  per-device timestamps and artifacts.
- When editing `app/src/main/assets/device-inventory.json`, remember the app copies the file into internal storage on
  first launch; subsequent updates flow through the Compose inventory card and the `SensorHardwareConfigRepository`.
- All Gradle test tasks are disabled per workflow guidance until instrumentation baselines are in place.
  **To enable tests:** `./gradlew test -Ptests.enabled=true`  
  **See:** `docs/guides/TEST_EXECUTION_GUIDE_2025-10-14.md` for full testing guide.
- Configure orchestrator target via `app` DataStore or Gradle `BuildConfig`.
- GSR artifacts are queued for upload after every recording stop (or unexpected disconnect) to keep the desktop dataset
  complete.
- Upload recovery logs are persisted beside each session (`upload_recovery.jsonl`), and backlog telemetry is captured in
  `backlog_telemetry.jsonl`; review both when validating offline retries or WorkManager behaviour.
- Build scripts auto-detect the system JDK (preferring `/usr/lib/jvm/java-{17,21}-openjdk-amd64` on Linux/WSL). If your
  Windows JDK lives elsewhere, set `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\gradle.properties` with
  `org.gradle.java.home=C:/Program Files/Java/jdk-17` (or similar) before running the creeping build. Run
  `tools/build/install_sdk_packages.sh` from WSL to bootstrap a Linux Android SDK (platform-tools, build-tools 35.0.0,
  android-35); the build still fails if it only sees Windows binaries such as `aapt.exe`. Point `local.properties` to
  the Linux SDK path (e.g. `/home/<you>/Android/Sdk`).
- Shimmer device cards now surface discovery, selection, and on-device configuration so settings stay in sync with the
  hardware.
- Hardware inventory is declaratively managed via `app/src/main/assets/device-inventory.json`; update ids, names, MAC
  addresses, or USB descriptors there to provision additional sensors.
- Thermal module navigation now exposes a dedicated Topdon console screen (scan, connect/disconnect, preview, settings).
- Live Session screen (hamburger navigation) summarises recording state, stream telemetry, recent events, uploads, and
  storage capacity using the new `SpaceMonitor` service.
- Session Library lists persisted manifests and opens per-session detail views backed by the manifest JSON.
- Settings screen wraps orchestrator target edits and retention scheduling; updates persist via
  `RetentionPreferencesRepository` and schedule WorkManager jobs with `WorkPolicy` helpers.
- `performance_metrics.jsonl` captures CPU/memory/storage samples while recording is active; inspect it during stress or
  soak tests to spot throttling and thermal drift. A computed summary is written to `performance_summary.json` once the
  session finalises.
- Result pattern error handling infrastructure is fully implemented with domain-specific helpers for Bluetooth, Storage,
  and Codec operations. See `docs/guides/ERROR_HANDLING_REFACTORING_EXAMPLES_2025-10-14.md` for refactoring patterns.
- Manual drills:
  - `docs/manual-tests/offline-recovery.md` for simulating upload retries and verifying recovery logs.
  - `docs/manual-tests/calibration-wizard.md` for the guided calibration walkthrough and metrics audit.
  - `docs/manual-tests/multi-device-stress.md` paired with `tools/perf/multi_device_stress.sh` to coordinate 8+ device
    soak tests and summarise recording telemetry. Use `tools/tests/offline_recovery.sh` to automate the reconnection
    drill against a specific device.
  - `tools/build/creeping_build.sh` provides a "creeping" build harness that iterates Gradle tasks, captures logs for
    each step, and continues past failures so CI/local runs do not abort on the first module.

- Zero risk cleanup ready to execute

See `docs/analysis/CONCURRENCY_THREADING_AUDIT_2025-10-14.md` for concurrency and threading analysis.

See `docs/analysis/CONCURRENCY_FIXES_IMPLEMENTED_2025-10-14.md` for Phase 1 concurrency fixes:
- ✅ Added ApplicationScope to DefaultRecordingService (recordings survive configuration changes)
- ✅ Added 30s timeout to Shimmer Bluetooth connections
- ✅ Added 20s timeout to Topdon USB connections
- ✅ Added 10s timeout to gRPC operations (command receipts, registration, status reports)
- ✅ Added 5s timeout to file finalisation operations

See `docs/analysis/CONCURRENCY_PHASE2_3_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-10-14.md` for Phase 2/3 implementation:
- ✅ Migrated MdnsAdvertiser and MdnsBrowser from AtomicBoolean to StateFlow
- ℹ️ Phase 2 (Handler migration) deferred - Handler usage is architecturally appropriate for Android/SDK APIs
- ℹ️ Remaining StateFlow candidates (GrpcServer, DeviceConnectionMonitor) deferred - simple flags appropriate as-is

See `docs/analysis/CONCURRENCY_PHASE4_ANALYSIS_2025-10-14.md` for Phase 4 threading primitives analysis:
- ✅ Analyzed all 5 @Volatile instances - all usage appropriate for cross-thread communication patterns
- ✅ Reviewed 12 AtomicBoolean instances - correct usage for guard flags and closures
- ℹ️ No changes needed - current patterns are optimal for the threading model

All critical resource leaks addressed. Production-ready resource management across all sensor connectors.

## Pending Focus

- Run a full multi-device soak (2x Shimmer, 2x Topdon) to validate sync accuracy, transfer retries, and retention
  alarms.
- Persist runtime inventory discoveries (Shimmer scans, Topdon attachments) back into `device-inventory.json`.
- Add preview throttling and colour controls ahead of field deployment.
- Wire ControlServer token issuance into the desktop controller/CLI and expose connection diagnostics in-app.
- HeartbeatMonitor should feed WARN/SAFE status into the recording UI and auto-stop logic.
- Expand retention scheduling UI with presets for long-form studies and integrate manifest export tooling.
