Before touching code, read `AGENTS.md` and comply with every requirement it lists. Ensure there is a written plan in `docs/tasks/active-plan.md` that captures the goal, acceptance criteria, risks, and a set of parallelisable task lists. If the file is missing or incomplete, create or update it first; keep the initial run focused on planning rather than implementation. When a plan is in place, work through the assigned tasks while following Jetpack Compose + Material 3 best practices, preserving Hilt / clean architecture boundaries, fixing every build error and warning, and adding or updating automated tests for the areas you change. Defer outputs that conflict with `AGENTS.md`.
