# Local Toolchains

This folder is git-ignored and hosts developer-specific payloads (Android SDK,
JDK, Gradle caches, optional NDK). Provisioning guidance, bootstrap commands,
and troubleshooting steps now live in `docs/development/environment.md`. Consult
that guide before modifying the layout here.

Because this folder is ignored, you can safely drop extracted SDK/NDK/JDK
archives here, and the repository will remain clean.
