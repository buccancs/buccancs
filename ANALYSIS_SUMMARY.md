# Repository Analysis Summary

**Generated:** 2025-10-13 19:57 UTC  
**Modified By:** GitHub Copilot CLI  
**Document Type:** Analysis Summary

## CODEBASE METRICS

- Total Kotlin files: 820
- Test files: 33 (4% coverage)
- Large files (>500 lines): 8
- Largest file: MainViewModel.kt (1,248 lines)
- External dependencies: Shimmer SDK, Topdon SDK, OpenCV

## IMPLEMENTATION STATUS

- Overall: 70% complete
- Android client: 85%
- Desktop orchestrator: 50%
- Protocol/Communication: 80%
- Testing infrastructure: 10%
- Documentation: 40%

## CRITICAL GAPS

1. Desktop file upload reception incomplete (blocks end-to-end testing)
2. Time synchronization accuracy never measured (NFR2 unvalidated)
3. Test coverage at 4% (all tests disabled)
4. Integration testing framework missing
5. 3 identified memory leak risks

## CODE QUALITY ISSUES

- MainViewModel: 1,248 lines (god object with 10 dependencies)
- ShimmerConnector: 706 lines (complex state machine)
- GrpcServer: 800+ lines (4 services in one file)
- Error handling: inconsistent, no Result pattern
- Resource cleanup: 51 .use{} blocks but leaks remain

## ARCHITECTURE QUALITY: C+

**Good:** MVVM, Hilt DI, Coroutines, module separation  
**Weak:** Testing, large files, mixed concerns, error handling

## IMMEDIATE ACTIONS (4-6 weeks)

1. Complete desktop orchestrator
2. Fix memory leaks
3. Enable tests, create integration framework
4. Refactor MainViewModel
5. Measure time sync accuracy
