# Copilot Instructions

- Always read `AGENTS.md` before acting and follow every requirement documented there.
- Prioritise planning via `docs/tasks/active-plan.md`; update the plan when it is missing, stale, or incomplete.
- Respect Jetpack Compose + Material 3 conventions, Hilt-based architecture, and Result-pattern error handling mandated in `AGENTS.md`.
- Run the Gradle, linting, and test commands linked in `AGENTS.md` for the modules you touch; explain any deviations in your response.
- Surface risks, manual validation steps, and documentation updates in line with the Pull Request expectations from `AGENTS.md`.
