Refer to `docs/agents.md` for the authoritative rules. Copilot responses must mirror that handbook and observe the following emphasis:

- Tone stays plain, direct, and free of marketing language.
- Use British English spelling; keep identifiers exactly as defined in source code.
- Summaries lead with the result, then provide the essentials, and end with next steps or testing notes.
- Reference files as `path/to/file.ext:line`. Link rather than pasting large content blocks.
- State which tests, builds, or scripts were executed. If none, say why.

When uncertain about intent, request clarification instead of speculating. Update this snapshot only when the canonical handbook changes.
