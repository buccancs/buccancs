## API Level Improvements Over Shimmer

| Aspect | Shimmer SDK | buccancs | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|----------|-------------|
| Bluetooth API scoping | Partial | Complete | maxSdkVersion properly set |
| Storage permissions | Basic | API-level specific | Proper 33+/34+ support |
| Foreground services | Generic | Type-specific | API 34+ compliance |
| Package visibility | Not declared | Queries block | API 30+ requirement |
| File sharing | file:// URIs | FileProvider | Security best practice |

---

## Shimmer Service Integration

### Shimmer Examples Declare Service
```xml
<service android:name="com.shimmerresearch.android.shimmerService.ShimmerService"/>
```

### buccancs Approach
The shimmer library module handles service declaration automatically. The app manifest doesn't need to redeclare it, as it's merged from the library's manifest during build.

**Verification:**
```bash
# Check merged manifest for ShimmerService
grep -i "shimmer" app/build/intermediates/merged_manifests/debug/processDebugManifest/AndroidManifest.xml
```

**Result:** ✅ Service merged automatically from library
