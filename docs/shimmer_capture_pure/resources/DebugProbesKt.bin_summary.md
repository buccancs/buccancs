# `resources/DebugProbesKt.bin`

- Kotlin Debug Probes binary shipped with the coroutine runtime.
- Enables debugger-friendly stack traces and coroutine inspection; not used directly by PURE code.
- Safe to regenerate by packaging kotlinx-coroutines with `kotlinx-coroutines-debug`.
- PURE bundles the default probe generated by Kotlin 1.8.x. When attached in Android Studio with coroutine debug tooling
  enabled, it lets you inspect coroutine hierarchies.
- If you do not rely on coroutine debugging, you can remove this asset to slightly reduce APK size; otherwise, keep it
  aligned with the Kotlin version you ship.
