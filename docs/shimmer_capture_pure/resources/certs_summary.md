# `resources/certs`

- PEM/KEY pairs for TLS test endpoints (`client.pem`, `server.pem`, `ca.pem`), plus OpenSSL config and index files.
- Used by the bundled gRPC examples (e.g., BLE bridge) for secure channel demos.
- Replace with your own certificates if you enable TLS in production; do **not** ship these keys in released builds.
- The helper classes under `com.shimmerresearch.grpc` reference these files when spinning up the demo server/client. If
  you remove TLS entirely, delete both the certs and the code paths that load them to avoid `FileNotFoundException`s.
- The directory mirrors the structure generated by gRPCâ€™s sample scripts (`make_certs.sh`). You can regenerate
  compatible bundles by running those scripts or using your internal PKI.
