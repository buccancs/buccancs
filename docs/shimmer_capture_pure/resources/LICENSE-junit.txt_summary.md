# `resources/LICENSE-junit.txt`

- Contains the JUnit (Eclipse Public License) notice bundled with the embedded testing framework.
- Required for compliance because the APK packages parts of JUnit in `sources/junit`.
- Keep this file (or an updated copy) if you continue redistributing JUnit classes inside one of your APK artifacts.
