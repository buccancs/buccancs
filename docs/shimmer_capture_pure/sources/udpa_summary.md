# `sources/udpa`

- Additional protobuf option annotations from the UDPA (Universal Data Plane API) project.
- Used by the generated gRPC classes to carry migration, security, and status metadata.
- No business logic; leave untouched unless regenerating the proto sources.
- Each file (e.g., `Migrate.java`, `Security.java`, `Status.java`) defines static `GeneratedExtension` fields that
  extend Googleâ€™s descriptor options. They are auto-generated by the `protoc` compiler with the UDPA plugin.
- Unless you are regenerating the proto artifacts yourself, keep these files as-is. Removing them will break descriptor
  initialisation in the gRPC runtime when parsing Envoy-related protos.
