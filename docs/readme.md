# Documentation Index

This directory now contains a curated, lightweight documentation set for the BuccanCS platform. Start with the system
overview for a conceptual grounding, then dip into the development, testing, or contributing guides as needed.

## Document Map

- `system-overview.md` – Purpose of the platform, component architecture, and data flow at a glance
- `automation.md` – Auto-continue harness for Copilot/Gemini CLI and custom agents
- `requirements.md` – Functional and non-functional targets with current delivery status
- `development.md` – Environment prerequisites, build commands, and day-to-day workflows
- `testing.md` – Automated coverage, manual drills, telemetry capture, and troubleshooting tips
- `contributing.md` – Coding conventions, documentation rules, and collaboration expectations
- `tasks/` – Active and archived task plans (see `tasks/README.md`)
- `latex/` – Thesis chapters and academic artefacts (retained for reference, unchanged)

## Using the Docs

- Read `system-overview.md` before approaching unfamiliar modules or planning new features.
- Keep `development.md` open when setting up a new machine or preparing demos.
- Follow `testing.md` when validating features, investigating regressions, or running stress drills.
- Review `contributing.md` before opening pull requests to ensure standards are met.

Legacy analysis reports and project diaries have been archived outside the repository to keep this workspace focused on
maintained guidance. If you need access to historical write-ups, consult the project owners.
