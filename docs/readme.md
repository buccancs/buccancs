# Documentation Index

This directory now contains a curated, lightweight documentation set for the BuccanCS platform. Start with the system
overview for a conceptual grounding, then consult `AGENTS.md` for the ground-truth contributor playbook before diving
into module-specific references.

## Document Map

- `system-overview.md` – Purpose of the platform, component architecture, and data flow at a glance
- `status/status-2025-10-17.md` – Consolidated build, automation, UI, and manifest snapshot (archived reports linked within)
- `automation.md` – Auto-continue harness details (supplements automation section in `AGENTS.md`)
- `requirements.md` – Functional and non-functional targets with current delivery status
- `development.md` – Extended environment notes and troubleshooting (see `AGENTS.md` for canonical checklist)
- `testing.md` – Manual drill instructions and artefact references (expectations defined in `AGENTS.md`)
- `contributing.md` – Historical guidance; all active policies live in `AGENTS.md`
- `tasks/` – Active and archived task plans (see `tasks/README.md`)
- `latex/` – Thesis chapters and academic artefacts (retained for reference, unchanged)

## Using the Docs

- Read `system-overview.md` before approaching unfamiliar modules or planning new features.
- Keep `development.md` open when setting up a new machine or preparing demos.
- Follow `testing.md` when validating features, investigating regressions, or running stress drills.
- Review `contributing.md` before opening pull requests to ensure standards are met.

Legacy analysis reports and project diaries have been archived outside the repository to keep this workspace focused on
maintained guidance. If you need access to historical write-ups, consult the project owners.
