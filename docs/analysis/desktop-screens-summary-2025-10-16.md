# Desktop Orchestrator Screens - Implementation Summary

## Overview

Implemented 8 additional screens for the Buccancs desktop orchestrator with proper navigation system, transforming it from a single-screen dashboard into a comprehensive multi-screen application.

## Screens Added

1. **Settings** - Server, storage, appearance, logging configuration
2. **Sensor Status** - Real-time monitoring of all sensors across devices
3. **Synchronisation** - Time sync status with visual offset indicators
4. **Calibration** - GSR and stereo camera calibration management
5. **Preview** - Live multi-camera feeds with grid layouts
6. **Video Playback** - Session review with playback controls
7. **File Explorer** - Browse and manage session data files
8. **Users** - Operator and subject management with GDPR compliance

## Navigation System

### Components Created
- **NavigationState.kt** - Type-safe screen definitions
- **NavigationRail.kt** - Material 3 side navigation with icons
- **OrchestratorApp.kt** - Main coordinator integrating all screens

### Features
- Persistent navigation rail (80dp width)
- Icon + label format
- Selected state highlighting
- Type-safe routing (no strings)
- Easy extensibility

## Technical Details

### Files Created
- 8 screen files (~78,000 bytes total)
- 2 navigation files
- 1 main coordinator
- **Total:** 11 new files

### Build Status
