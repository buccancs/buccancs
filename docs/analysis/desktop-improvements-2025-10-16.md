# Desktop App Improvements - 2025-10-16

## Executive Summary

The desktop orchestrator has been enhanced with critical missing features including mDNS service discovery for automatic agent detection and improved error handling for port conflicts. The app successfully builds and runs with all improvements integrated.

## Context

The desktop application serves as the orchestrator/server in the BuccanCS architecture whilst the Android app functions as the client/agent. The Android app has significantly more features (~30,000 LOC vs ~4,600 LOC) because it includes hardware integration, sensors, UI screens, and data collection logic. This is by design - the desktop app is not meant to mirror the Android client but rather coordinate multiple Android agents.

## Changes Implemented

### 1. mDNS Service Discovery (NEW)

**File Created:** `desktop/src/main/kotlin/com/buccancs/desktop/data/discovery/MdnsServiceBrowser.kt`

- Implemented JmDNS-based service discovery to automatically detect Android agents on the local network
- Exposes `StateFlow<List<DiscoveredDevice>>` for reactive UI updates
- Handles service lifecycle (start/stop) with proper cleanup
- Logs discovered devices with addresses, ports, and attributes

**Key Features:**
- Automatic discovery of `_buccancs._tcp.local.` services
- Non-blocking coroutine-based implementation
- Graceful error handling and logging
- Supports multiple discovered devices simultaneously

### 2. Dependency Management

**File Modified:** `desktop/build.gradle.kts`

Added JmDNS library dependency:
```kotlin
implementation("org.jmdns:jmdns:3.5.9")
```

### 3. Dependency Injection Updates

**File Modified:** `desktop/src/main/kotlin/com/buccancs/desktop/di/AppGraph.kt`

- Integrated `MdnsServiceBrowser` into the application graph
- Added proper lifecycle management (start on init, stop on shutdown)
- Exposed browser via `provideMdnsServiceBrowser()` method

### 4. Enhanced Error Handling

**File Modified:** `desktop/src/main/kotlin/com/buccancs/desktop/data/grpc/GrpcServer.kt`

- Added try-catch around server start with proper error logging
- Throws `IllegalStateException` with clear message when port is already in use
- Sets atomic state correctly on failure to prevent inconsistent state

### 5. Application Startup Improvements

**File Modified:** `desktop/src/main/kotlin/com/buccancs/desktop/Main.kt`

- Added graceful handling of gRPC server startup failures
- Displays clear error message when port 50051 is already in use
- Properly cleans up mDNS browser on application exit
- Early exit prevents zombie UI when server fails to start

## Testing Results

### Build Verification

```
./gradlew :desktop:build
BUILD SUCCESSFUL in 3s
14 actionable tasks: 14 up-to-date
```

### Runtime Verification

Application starts successfully with:
- mDNS service discovery initialized and running
- gRPC server listening on port 50051
- No compilation errors or warnings
- Proper logging of all services

### Observed Logs

```
[DefaultDispatcher-worker-3] INFO MdnsServiceBrowser - Starting mDNS service discovery for _buccancs._tcp.local.
[DefaultDispatcher-worker-3] INFO MdnsServiceBrowser - mDNS browser started successfully
[AWT-EventQueue-0] INFO GrpcServer - gRPC server started on port 50051
```

## Architecture Notes

The desktop app deliberately has fewer features than the Android app because:

1. **Desktop = Orchestrator Role**
   - Coordinates multiple Android agents
   - Manages session lifecycle
   - Aggregates data uploads
   - Provides reference time sync service
   - Exposes monitoring UI

2. **Android = Agent Role**
   - Hardware sensor integration (Shimmer GSR, Topdon thermal, cameras)
   - Data collection and local buffering
   - Upload to desktop orchestrator
   - Responds to remote commands

3. **Separation of Concerns**
   - Desktop doesn't need sensor connectors or hardware drivers
   - Android doesn't need multi-device coordination logic
   - Each optimised for its platform constraints

## Outstanding Work

Features still requiring implementation (from requirements.md):

1. **Hardware Discovery** - Android agents should automatically connect to discovered orchestrator
2. **Preview Transport** - Live RGB/thermal preview streaming to desktop UI (stubbed)
3. **Stimulus Authoring** - UI tools for creating stimulus sequences
4. **Upload Ingestion Verification** - Desktop-side validation of received artifacts
5. **End-to-End Hardware Validation** - Physical testing with multiple agents

## Files Modified Summary

| File | Lines Changed | Type |
|------|--------------|------|
| `desktop/data/discovery/MdnsServiceBrowser.kt` | +111 | New file |
| `desktop/build.gradle.kts` | +2 | Modified |
| `desktop/di/AppGraph.kt` | +9 | Modified |
| `desktop/data/grpc/GrpcServer.kt` | +7 | Modified |
| `desktop/Main.kt` | +12 | Modified |

**Total:** 141 lines added/modified across 5 files

## Next Steps

### Immediate (UI Enhancement)
1. Display discovered mDNS devices in the desktop UI
2. Add connection status indicators for each discovered agent
3. Show agent metadata (platform, model, battery level) from mDNS attributes

### Short-term (Integration)
1. Implement preview frame streaming from agents to desktop
2. Add stimulus authoring interface
3. Enhance upload verification and reconciliation

### Long-term (Validation)
1. Multi-agent orchestration testing with physical hardware
2. Network resilience testing (WiFi drops, latency spikes)
3. Performance profiling under sustained data upload load

## Conclusion

The desktop orchestrator now has the critical mDNS discovery feature needed for automatic agent detection whilst maintaining proper error handling for common deployment issues. The application builds cleanly and runs successfully with all services initialised. The architecture properly reflects the orchestrator vs agent separation where the desktop coordinates whilst Android agents perform data collection.

The ~6.5:1 code size ratio (Android vs Desktop) is appropriate given their distinct roles. Further feature additions should focus on orchestration capabilities rather than attempting feature parity with the Android client.
