import re
import statistics

offsets = []
rtts = []

with open('sync_reports.txt', 'r') as f:
    for line in f:
        # Extract offset and RTT from log line
        # Format: "Sync report from DEVICE offset=X.Xms rtt=Y.Yms"
        offset_match = re.search(r'offset=([-\d.]+)ms', line)
        rtt_match = re.search(r'rtt=([\d.]+)ms', line)
        
        if offset_match and rtt_match:
            offsets.append(abs(float(offset_match.group(1))))
            rtts.append(float(rtt_match.group(1)))
