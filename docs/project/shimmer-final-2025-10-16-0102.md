# Shimmer Compose Implementation - Final Report

## Executive Summary

Successfully completed migration of Shimmer device interface from XML to Jetpack Compose with full MVVM architecture,
comprehensive testing, and integration with existing device management infrastructure.

## Implementation Overview

### Phase 1: UI Components (Completed 00:12 UTC)

- Created 6 reusable Material 3 card components
- Implemented ShimmerScreen with proper navigation
- Added ShimmerScreenViewModel with state management
- Created comprehensive unit tests (19 total)
- Added KDoc comments and preview functions

### Phase 2: Infrastructure Integration (Completed 01:02 UTC)

- Integrated with DeviceManagementUseCase
- Connected to existing BLE scanning
- Observes device state from repository
- Real connection/disconnection operations
- Updated tests for new architecture

## Architecture

### Clean Architecture Compliance

```
UI Layer (Compose)
    ↓
ViewModel (State Management)
    ↓
Use Cases (Business Logic)
    ↓
Repositories (Data Access)
    ↓
Connectors (Hardware Interface)
```

### Key Components

1. **ShimmerScreen** - Main composable with Scaffold
2. **ShimmerScreenViewModel** - Business logic with StateFlow
3. **DeviceManagementUseCase** - Device operations abstraction
4. **HardwareConfigurationUseCase** - Settings management
5. **ShimmerSensorConnector** - BLE device communication

### State Flow

```
SensorRepository.devices (Flow)
    ↓
DeviceManagementUseCase.devices
    ↓
ShimmerScreenViewModel observes
    ↓
ShimmerScreenUiState updates
    ↓
ShimmerScreen recomposes
```

3. Taps "Configure" button (when connected)
4. ShimmerScreen opens
5. Can connect/disconnect device
6. Configure GSR range and sample rate
7. View live sensor data
8. Back button returns to Devices screen

## Technical Details

### State Management

```kotlin
data class ShimmerScreenUiState(
    val isConnected: Boolean,
    val isConnecting: Boolean,
    val isStreaming: Boolean,
    val isScanning: Boolean,
    val deviceName: String?,
    val deviceAddress: String?,
    val gsrRangeIndex: Int,
    val sampleRate: Double,
    // ... sensor data fields
    val errorMessage: String?
)
```

### Device State Observation

```kotlin
viewModelScope.launch {
    deviceManagement.devices.collect { devices ->
        val shimmerDevice = devices.find { it.id == deviceId }
        // Update UI state based on device state
    }
}
```

### Connection Flow

```kotlin
fun connectDevice() {
    viewModelScope.launch {
        val result = deviceManagement.connectDevice(deviceId)
        // Handle result, update error state
    }
}
```

## Future Enhancements
