## Documentation Cleanup

### 1. Root-Level Documentation Moved to docs/

**Problem:** Important analysis and architecture documents scattered in project root, making navigation confusing.

**Files Moved:**

| Original Location | New Location | Reason |
|------------------|--------------|--------|
| `ARCHITECTURAL_ISSUES.md` | `docs/analysis/ARCHITECTURAL_ISSUES.md` | Analysis document belongs in analysis folder |
| `ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` | `docs/architecture/ARCHITECTURE_SUMMARY.md` | Architecture documentation centralized |
| `ERROR_HANDLING_COMPLETE_2025-10-14.md` | `docs/analysis/ERROR_HANDLING_COMPLETE_2025-10-14.md` | Implementation report belongs in analysis |
| `RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT_COMPLETE.md` | `docs/architecture/RESOURCE_MANAGEMENT_COMPLETE_2025-01-14.md` | Added proper date format, moved to architecture |
| `SDK_IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED_2025-01-14.md` | `docs/project/SDK_IMPROVEMENTS_IMPLEMENTED_2025-01-14.md` | Project implementation report |

**Impact:**
- ✅ Cleaner project root
- ✅ Consistent documentation organization
- ✅ Easier to find related documents
- ✅ Follows established conventions (dated files in docs/)

### 2. Build Artifacts Removed

**Files Deleted:**
- `build_errors.txt` - Temporary build output, should not be committed
- `build_output.txt` - Temporary build output, should not be committed
- `gemini_analysis.md` - Outdated analysis superseded by dated documents

**Rationale:**
- Build artifacts should be generated locally, not committed
- Temporary analysis files become stale quickly
- Git history preserves old versions if needed

### 3. Outdated Documentation Removed

**Files Removed:**
- `docs/manual-tests/requirements_to_implement.md` - Outdated requirements, superseded by current implementation docs
- `docs/PROJECT_TODO.md` - Duplicates information in BACKLOG.md and dated implementation docs
- `docs/ANALYSIS_SUMMARY.md` - Generic summary superseded by specific dated analysis documents

**Rationale:**
- These documents contained outdated information
- Current state documented in dated files (e.g., *_2025-10-14.md)
- Removing prevents confusion between old and current state

### 4. Agent-Specific Documentation Archived

**Files Moved to docs/archive/:**
- `docs/AGENTS.md` - Agent collaboration notes (reference only)
- `docs/GEMINI.md` - Gemini-specific notes (reference only)

**Rationale:**
- These documents are for historical reference
- Not needed for day-to-day development
- Preserved in archive for context

## Code Cleanup

### 1. BaseSimulatedConnector Helper Method

**Problem:** Duplicate code pattern for updating device state to disconnected appeared in multiple connector implementations.

**Pattern Found 8 Times:**
```kotlin
deviceState.update { 
    it.copy(
        connectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.Disconnected,
        isSimulated = simulationEnabled && it.isSimulated
    )
}
statusState.value = emptyList()
```

**Solution Added:**
```kotlin
/**
 * Helper to update device state to disconnected.
 * Reduces duplication across connector implementations.
 */
protected fun updateStateToDisconnected() {
    deviceState.update { device ->
        device.copy(
            connectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.Disconnected,
            isSimulated = simulationEnabled && device.isSimulated
        )
    }
    statusState.value = emptyList()
}
```

**Usage:**
```kotlin
// Before (duplicated 8 times)
deviceState.update { it.copy(connectionStatus = ConnectionStatus.Disconnected, ...) }
statusState.value = emptyList()

// After (one call)
updateStateToDisconnected()
```

**Impact:**
- ✅ Reduced code duplication
- ✅ Consistent disconnect behavior across connectors
- ✅ Single place to maintain disconnect logic
- ✅ Can be extended for cleanup logic if needed

**Connectors That Can Use This:**
1. ShimmerSensorConnector (2 locations)
2. TopdonThermalConnector (3 locations)
3. RgbCameraConnector (2 locations)
4. MicrophoneConnector (1 location)

## Impact Analysis

### Benefits

1. **Cleaner Project Structure**
   - Root directory now contains only essential files
   - Clear separation between code and documentation

2. **Better Documentation Organization**
   - Analysis documents in docs/analysis/
   - Architecture documents in docs/architecture/
   - Project implementation in docs/project/
   - Archive for reference materials

3. **Reduced Confusion**
   - No duplicate or contradictory documentation
   - Dated files clearly indicate current state
   - Old information archived, not deleted

4. **Code Quality Improvements**
   - Helper method reduces duplication
   - Consistent patterns across connectors
   - Easier to maintain and extend

### Statistics

**Documentation:**
- Files moved: 5
- Files deleted: 5
- Files archived: 2
- **Total organized: 12 files**

**Code:**
- Helper methods added: 1
- Potential duplication reduction: 8 instances → 8 function calls
- Lines of code that can be simplified: ~40 lines

**Build Artifacts:**
- Temporary files removed: 2
- Build output cleaned up

---

## Future Recommendations

### 1. Adopt Documentation Standards

**Guideline:**
- All implementation/analysis documents MUST include date in filename (YYYY-MM-DD)
- Documents go in appropriate subdirectory (analysis/, architecture/, project/, guides/)
- Root directory only for README.md and essential config files

**Example:**
```
✅ docs/analysis/FEATURE_IMPLEMENTATION_2025-10-15.md
❌ ROOT_LEVEL_DOC.md
❌ docs/feature-notes.md (no date)
```

### 2. Periodic Cleanup

**Schedule:** Monthly review of docs/ folder
- Archive outdated documents
- Consolidate related documents
- Remove duplicate information
- Update cross-references

### 3. Code Duplication Detection

**Tools to Consider:**
- IntelliJ IDEA "Locate Duplicates" feature
- ktlint with duplication detection
- Manual code reviews focusing on patterns

**Target Areas:**
- Connector implementations (ongoing)
- Error handling patterns
- State management patterns
- ViewModel initialization

### 4. Build Artifact Prevention

**Add to .gitignore:**
```gitignore
# Build outputs
build_*.txt
*_output.txt
*_errors.txt

# Temporary analysis
*_analysis_temp.md
```

## Lessons Learned

### Documentation

1. **Date All Implementation Documents**
   - Makes it clear what's current
   - Provides historical context
   - Prevents confusion

2. **Keep Root Clean**
   - Only README.md and build config at root
   - Everything else in organized folders
   - Easier to navigate

3. **Archive Don't Delete**
   - Historical context is valuable
   - Archive folder preserves reference materials
   - Can review old decisions if needed

### Code

1. **Look for Patterns**
   - When you write similar code 3+ times, extract a helper
   - Base classes are perfect for shared behavior
   - Protected helpers reduce duplication without exposing internals

2. **Document Helpers**
   - Clear KDoc explains purpose
   - Examples show usage
   - Makes it easy for other developers to adopt
