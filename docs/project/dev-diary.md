### Topdon UI Material 3 Status Verification

**Time:** 13:12 - 13:20 UTC  
**Status:** Scope Clarification Required

**Work Done:**

Verified Topdon UI Material 3 compliance status following request to begin Material 3 migration.

**Initial Finding - Buccancs App Topdon UI:**

Topdon UI (TopdonScreen.kt) is already fully migrated to Material 3 with modern components (ElevatedCard, FilledTonalButton, proper icons, colour schemes). No migration work needed.

**Secondary Investigation - Original Topdon App:**

Examined `external/original-topdon-app` structure:

1. **Technology Stack:**
   - Traditional Android Views with XML layouts (not Compose)
   - 15 XML layout files
   - ViewPager2, ConstraintLayout-based UI
   - Kotlin synthetic views (deprecated)
   - No Compose dependencies

2. **Architecture:**
   - MainActivity with ViewPager2 hosting fragments
   - XML-based UI with View binding disabled
   - Traditional Activity/Fragment architecture
   - ARouter navigation

3. **Scope Assessment:**

Converting this entire app to Compose Material 3 would require:
- Converting 15 XML layouts to Composable functions
- Replacing all Activities/Fragments with Compose screens
- Migrating ViewPager2 to Compose Pager
- Converting ConstraintLayout logic to Compose layouts
- Updating navigation from ARouter to Compose Navigation
- Adding Compose BOM dependencies
- Estimated effort: 20-30 hours for complete conversion

**Question:**

The original-topdon-app is a reference implementation showing Topdon SDK usage. Options:

A) Keep it as-is for SDK reference (recommended)
B) Modernise only MainActivity and MainFragment as proof of concept (~2-3 hours)
C) Full conversion to Compose Material 3 (~20-30 hours)

**Files Examined:**
- external/original-topdon-app/app/src/main/java/com/topdon/tc001/MainActivity.kt
- external/original-topdon-app/app/src/main/res/layout/*.xml (15 files)
- external/original-topdon-app/app/build.gradle

**Awaiting clarification on desired scope.**

- Created GAPS_AND_UNFINISHED.md with detailed status of all functional and non-functional requirements
- Identified critical blockers: desktop orchestrator ~50% complete, zero integration tests, time sync unvalidated
- Documented 18 major gap areas with prioritized 14-20 week roadmap for completion
- Staged control networking foundations: control.proto, ControlServer skeleton, token issuance/interceptor, and mDNS
  advertiser/browser
- Extended README/backlog with the new control-service roadmap and captured follow-ups for heartbeat wiring and sync
  telemetry UI

## 2025-10-13

- Started the on-device ControlServer from DeviceCommandService, merged local command traffic with orchestrator
  subscriptions, and exposed token issuance via `issueLocalToken`
- Added BuildConfig-driven control port, fed local commands through existing flows, and updated docs/backlog for the
  next integration tasks

## 2025-10-13

- Added recording manifest writer plus consistent artifact naming and wired `DefaultRecordingService` to persist session
  metadata
- Introduced `SpaceMonitor`, retention preferences repository, WorkManager-powered Upload/Retention workers, and a
  settings screen to apply orchestrator/retention policy
- Replaced `SessionClock` with `TimeModelAdapter`, normalised Topdon thermal frames, and surfaced live telemetry (
  streams, uploads, events, storage) via the new Live Session screen
- Implemented session library and manifest detail views backed by the stored manifests and refreshed README/backlog to
  reflect the new UI and background services

## 2025-10-13

- Replaced the RGB MediaRecorder path with a MediaCodec + MediaMuxer pipeline that writes crash-safe MediaStore
  segments, tracks encoder stats, and enqueues artifacts with per-segment metadata
- Added bookmark repository/UI wiring so operators can drop timeline markers during capture and see them in session
  detail views
- Refreshed Live Session, Settings, and manifest screens to surface encoder telemetry, bookmark lists, and cleaner state
  flows; updated README/backlog to capture the new recording workflow

## 2025-10-14

- Instrumented upload recovery logging (WorkManager retries -> UI + `upload_recovery.jsonl`) and noted follow-up to
  simulate mid-transfer drops
- Documented the offline recovery dry-run in `docs/manual-tests/offline-recovery.md` so field teams can force
  disconnects, capture retries, and archive JSONL/WorkManager evidence
- Swapped calibration card for the guided wizard with confidence metrics persisted via DataStore and wrote the operator
  walkthrough in `docs/manual-tests/calibration-wizard.md`
- Started capturing CPU/memory/storage telemetry per session into `performance_metrics.jsonl` to prep for 8+ device
  stress runs
- Added backlog overflow guardrails (warning/critical thresholds, UI card, drop-newest policy) and recorded behaviour
  for manual review during soak tests
- Authored `tools/perf/multi_device_stress.sh` + `tools/perf/analyze_metrics.py` with
  `docs/manual-tests/multi-device-stress.md` to script coordinated 8+ device stress rehearsals and capture performance
  summaries
- Brought in `BacklogTelemetryLogger` and `tools/tests/offline_recovery.sh` to automate reconnection drills and persist
  backlog snapshots alongside each session
- Introduced adaptive capture throttling via `BacklogPerformanceController` and exposed throttle state in Live Session
- Added `PerformanceMetricsAnalyzer` to emit `performance_summary.json` for every session, powering automated trending
  of CPU/memory/storage data
- Taught the creeping build script to export `JAVA_HOME`/`org.gradle.java.home`, leaving Windows users to set
  `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\gradle.properties` when needed
- Noted in docs that Android build-tools 35.0.0 must be installed; Gradle reports a missing `aapt` otherwise (seen on
  WSL-hosted SDK)

## 2025-10-13

- Conducted comprehensive technical debt analysis covering implementation gaps, architectural issues, and code quality
