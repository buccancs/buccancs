## Migration Approach

Rather than directly translating XML to Compose 1:1, the implementation uses:

- Modern Compose patterns and best practices
- Material 3 design system
- Proper state management
- Reusable composable functions
- Type-safe navigation
- Clean architecture principles

## Original XML Layouts Referenced

- `activity_main.xml` - Bottom navigation
- `fragment_main.xml` - Main device screen states
- `item_device_connect.xml` - Device list items
- `ui_main_connection_guide.xml` - Connection instructions
- `activity_ir_gallery_home.xml` - Gallery grid
- `activity_ir_camera_setting.xml` - Settings screen

## Integration Status

All new components and screens are:

- Created with proper package structure
- Following existing TOPDON UI patterns
- Using Material 3 design system
- Compatible with existing ViewModel architecture
- Ready for navigation integration

## Next Steps

1. Integrate new screens into navigation graph
2. Connect Gallery screen to actual data repository
3. Wire up Settings screen to TopdonViewModel
4. Add detail screens for gallery items
5. Implement palette and super sampling selection dialogs
6. Create profile/settings main screen
7. Add image capture and storage functionality

## Migration Progress Update

**Previous Status:** Core features 40% complete  
**Current Status:** Core features 40%, Additional UI 10% complete  
**Overall Progress:** ~45% complete
