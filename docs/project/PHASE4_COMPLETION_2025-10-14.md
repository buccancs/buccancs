## Test Patterns Established

### 1. Load Testing Pattern

```kotlin
class LoadTestingTest {
    @Test
    fun `performance under load`() = runTest {
        val executionTime = measureTimeMillis {
            // Heavy operations
        }
        assertTrue(executionTime < threshold)
    }
}
```

### 2. Resource Constraint Pattern

```kotlin
class ResourceConstraintsTest {
    @Test
    fun `handles resource limit`() {
        val constraint = createExtremeCondition()
        // Verify system handles gracefully
    }
}
```

### 3. Long-Running Test Pattern

```kotlin
class ExtendedSessionTest {
    @Test
    fun `sustained operations over time`() = runTest {
        repeat(largeNumber) {
            operation()
            if (periodic) delay(1)
        }
        // Verify consistency maintained
    }
}
```

### 4. Crash Recovery Pattern

```kotlin
class CrashRecoveryTest {
    @Test
    fun `recovers from failure`() = runTest {
        // Normal operation
        // Simulate crash
        // Verify recovery
    }
}
```
