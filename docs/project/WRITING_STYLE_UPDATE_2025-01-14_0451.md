# Writing Style Guidelines Added

## Summary

Added writing style requirements to copilot-instructions.md. Documentation and code comments must use plain language without overstatement or unnecessary complexity.

## Changes

### Communication Style Section
Updated Core Principles with specific requirements:
- Use plain language
- Avoid jargon and buzzwords
- State facts without exaggeration
- Professional dry tone
- Prefer simple words
- No marketing language
- No superlatives

### Examples Added
Provided concrete examples of good vs. bad writing:

**Good:**
- "Fixed memory leak"
- "Added cleanup method"
- "Uses mutex for thread safety"

**Bad:**
- "Successfully eliminated critical issue"
- "Implemented comprehensive solution"
- "Leverages synchronisation primitives"

## Rationale

**Problem:** Documentation becoming verbose with unnecessary complexity and exaggeration.

**Solution:** Explicit style requirements with examples.
