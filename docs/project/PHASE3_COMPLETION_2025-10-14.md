## Test Patterns Established

### 1. Integration Test Pattern
```kotlin
@HiltAndroidTest
@RunWith(RobolectricTestRunner::class)
@Config(application = HiltTestApplication::class)
class WorkflowIntegrationTest {
    @get:Rule
    val hiltRule = HiltAndroidRule(this)
    
    @Test
    fun `complete workflow succeeds`() = runTest {
        // Given - setup multiple components
        // When - execute workflow
        // Then - verify all interactions
    }
}
```

### 2. Edge Case Test Pattern
```kotlin
class EdgeCasesTest {
    @Test
    fun `boundary condition handled`() = runTest {
        // Test with extreme values
        // Verify no crashes or unexpected behavior
    }
}
```

### 3. Error Scenario Test Pattern
```kotlin
class ErrorScenariosTest {
    @Test
    fun `failure scenario handled gracefully`() {
        // Given - error condition
        // When - operation attempted
        // Then - error handled appropriately
    }
}
```

### 4. Concurrent Operations Test Pattern
```kotlin
class ConcurrentOperationsTest {
    @Test
    fun `concurrent operations are thread-safe`() = runTest {
        val jobs = List(100) { launch { operation() } }
        jobs.forEach { it.join() }
        // Verify consistency
    }
}
```
