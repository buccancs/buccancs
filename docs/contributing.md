# Contributing Guide

All active contributor requirements now live in `AGENTS.md`, which serves as the canonical reference for workflow,
coding standards, testing, automation, and review expectations.

This document is retained for historical context only. When updating processes or onboarding material, edit
`AGENTS.md` first and then link to it from other references as needed.
