## Critical Missing Features

### Must Have (Essential - Blocking)
1. **FR5: End-to-End Recording** - Core functionality not verified
2. **FR10: Automatic File Transfer** - Workflow incomplete
3. **FR1: Simulation Mode** - Cannot test without hardware

### Should Have (Important)
4. **FR7: Sync Signals** - Data alignment quality
5. **FR9: Calibration Tools** - Data accuracy

### Nice to Have
6. **NFR8: Documentation** - User guides, API docs

## What's Working Well ✅

- ✅ **Time Synchronization** (FR3) - Exceeds requirements (4-7ms)
- ✅ **gRPC Communication** - Fully proven and tested
- ✅ **Cross-Platform** (NFR6) - Windows, Linux, macOS support
- ✅ **Security** (NFR1) - Encryption implemented
- ✅ **Device Connection** - Multi-device support working
- ✅ **Command Infrastructure** - Start/stop commands ready

## What Needs Work 🔴

### High Priority
- 🔴 **Recording Workflow** - Not tested end-to-end
- 🔴 **File Transfer** - Automation not working
- 🔴 **All Modalities** - GSR, video, thermal, audio together
- 🔴 **GUI Verification** - Controls not tested

### Medium Priority
- 🟡 **Sync Signals** - Flash/audio markers missing
- 🟡 **Calibration** - Tools incomplete
- 🟡 **Error Recovery** - Auto-reconnection needed

### Low Priority
- 🟢 **Documentation** - User manuals needed
- 🟢 **Testing Coverage** - More integration tests
