# Active Task Plan: Hardware Integration & Testing Phase

**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Target completion**: 2025-10-23  
**Status**: ðŸ”µ Active

## Objective

Complete end-to-end hardware validation and bring the platform to production-ready state by integrating physical sensors, verifying multi-device coordination, and eliminating outstanding infrastructure blockers.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. âœ… Android agent connects successfully to physical Shimmer3 GSR sensor and captures valid 128 Hz data
2. âœ… Topdon TC001 thermal camera integration captures and stores thermal frames with correct metadata
3. âœ… Desktop orchestrator discovers multiple Android agents via mDNS and maintains stable gRPC connections
4. âœ… Time synchronisation achieves <10 ms offset across all connected devices during 5-minute test session
5. âœ… Complete recording session produces valid manifest, GSR CSV, RGB MP4, thermal frames, and audio on all agents
6. âœ… Upload pipeline successfully transfers all artefacts to desktop with retry verification
7. âœ… Android SDK Platform 36 licence accepted and full build passes without warnings
8. âœ… At least one automated test suite re-enabled and passing in CI

## Priority Tasks

### Phase 1: Hardware Setup & Basic Connectivity (Days 1-2)

- [ ] **T1.1** Connect physical Shimmer3 GSR sensor to Android device via Bluetooth
- [ ] **T1.2** Verify Shimmer3 pairing, configuration, and raw data stream in HardwareDebugger
- [ ] **T1.3** Connect Topdon TC001 thermal camera to Android device via USB
- [ ] **T1.4** Test thermal camera preview, capture, and frame export with real hardware
- [ ] **T1.5** Document hardware connection procedures and troubleshooting steps

### Phase 2: Multi-Device Orchestration (Days 3-4)

- [ ] **T2.1** Launch desktop orchestrator and verify mDNS device discovery broadcasts from Android
- [ ] **T2.2** Establish gRPC connections from desktop to 2+ Android agents simultaneously
- [ ] **T2.3** Test time synchronisation service with multiple devices and measure offsets
- [ ] **T2.4** Execute coordinated start/stop commands across all agents
- [ ] **T2.5** Verify heartbeat monitoring and reconnection logic during network interruptions

### Phase 3: End-to-End Recording Session (Days 5-6)

- [ ] **T3.1** Configure recording session on desktop with all modalities enabled
- [ ] **T3.2** Start coordinated recording across all agents with physical sensors active
- [ ] **T3.3** Capture 5-minute session with GSR, thermal, RGB, and audio data
- [ ] **T3.4** Stop session and verify manifest generation on all devices
- [ ] **T3.5** Validate artefact completeness: GSR CSV integrity, video encoding, thermal frame sequences
- [ ] **T3.6** Monitor upload pipeline and verify all artefacts transfer to desktop successfully

### Phase 4: Infrastructure & Build Fixes (Days 6-7)

- [ ] **T4.1** Accept Android SDK Platform 36 licences on development machine
- [ ] **T4.2** Run full Gradle build and resolve any remaining compilation issues
- [ ] **T4.3** Re-enable suspended test suites one module at a time
- [ ] **T4.4** Fix test infrastructure blockers preventing test execution
- [ ] **T4.5** Verify at least app core tests pass with `-Ptests.enabled=true`

### Phase 5: Polish & Documentation (Day 7)

- [ ] **T5.1** Update `docs/system-overview.md` with validated hardware configurations
- [ ] **T5.2** Document measured time sync performance and session recording metrics
- [ ] **T5.3** Create hardware setup guide with photos/diagrams for lab replication
- [ ] **T5.4** Update requirements.md with current completion status
- [ ] **T5.5** Archive this task plan and create new backlog items for remaining work

## Risks & Mitigations

| Risk | Probability | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|-------------|--------|------------|
| Shimmer3 pairing failures | Medium | High | Document alternative pairing procedures; implement fallback simulation mode |
| Thermal camera driver issues | Medium | High | Maintain existing Topdon library; prepare USB debugging procedures |
| Desktop mDNS discovery flaky | Medium | Medium | Add manual IP entry fallback; improve discovery retry logic |
| Time sync drift exceeds target | Low | Medium | Increase sync sample frequency; validate NTP math implementation |
| Upload pipeline stalls | Low | High | Exercise retry logic thoroughly; add manual upload trigger |
| SDK licence acceptance blocked | High | Medium | Use alternative build machine; document manual acceptance procedure |

## Parallel Work Streams

- **Stream A** (Hardware): T1.1â†’T1.2â†’T1.3â†’T1.4 (serial sensor validation)
- **Stream B** (Desktop): T2.1â†’T2.2â†’T2.3 (orchestrator services)
- **Stream C** (Infrastructure): T4.1â†’T4.2â†’T4.3 (build & test fixes)

Streams A and B can proceed independently until Phase 3 integration. Stream C can run continuously alongside other phases.

## Verification Notes

After each phase, update this file with:
- Actual completion dates and time spent
- Hardware configuration details (device models, firmware versions)
- Measured performance metrics (sync offsets, frame rates, upload throughput)
- Issues encountered and resolutions applied
- Links to test artefacts, logs, and captured data samples

## Next Actions

1. Verify phone and peripherals are connected (âœ… Complete)
2. Check repository status (âœ… Complete)
3. Begin Phase 1: Connect Shimmer3 GSR sensor
4. Set up hardware debugging environment
