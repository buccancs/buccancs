# Task Plans

Store active and archived task plans in this directory.

- Use `active-plan.md` for the current piece of work. This file should summarise
  the objective, acceptance criteria, risks, and parallelisable task lists with
  owners or recommended session assignments.

- When a plan is completed, rename it to a dated archive (for example,
  `task-plan-2025-10-16-completion.md`) before starting the next plan.

- Capture completed milestones in a sibling note (for example,
  `milestone-2025-10-20-topdon-phase2.md`) so historic context stays close
  without bloating `active-plan.md`. Hardware-specific retrospectives belong in
  `../hardware/` once they are stable references.

- Each task list should be actionable by a single agent session and include any
  prerequisites, verification steps, and expected artefacts (code changes,
  tests, documentation).
