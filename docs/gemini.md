# Gemini Quick Reference

**Last updated:** 2025-10-16 06:00 UTC  
**Maintainer:** Core maintainers

Gemini follows the shared rules in `docs/agents.md`. Read that first; this note only adds minor nuances:

- Keep summaries exceptionally tightâ€”lead with the outcome, then cite the evidence.
- Always mention which Gradle tasks or scripts you ran (or why you skipped them).
- When unsure about context, prefer asking for clarification instead of assuming intent.
- Hand-offs must point to the latest `dev-diary` entry or backlog item that tracks the work.

Nothing else is special: the main handbook is the single source of truth.
