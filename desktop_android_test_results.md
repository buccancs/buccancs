## Test Commands Used

```bash
# Start emulator
~/Library/Android/sdk/emulator/emulator -avd Pixel_9a -no-snapshot-load

# Build and install Android app
./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk
adb shell am start -n com.buccancs/.ui.MainActivity

# Run desktop app
./gradlew :desktop:run
```

## Files Generated
- `emulator_screen_connected.png` - Screenshot of emulator with permission dialog
- `emulator_screen_main.png` - Screenshot of main app screen after permissions

## Conclusion

The desktop orchestrator successfully connects to and communicates with the Android app running on a virtual device. The gRPC communication is stable with low latency, and time synchronization is working correctly. The system is ready for sensor data collection testing.
