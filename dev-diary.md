- Extended Topdon connector to stream super-sampled previews locally and adjust remote payload metadata

## 2025-10-12

- Cleaned calibration pipeline typing to resolve Mat conversions and restored OpenCV init path for Android
- Hardened preview upload/queues and moved shimmer emissions onto the application scope to avoid suspend-context leaks
- Reworked dashboard UI to expose Topdon console access and non-Exposed dropdown controls
- Added Topdon metadata artifacts (JSON) alongside raw thermal captures so they enter the existing transfer queue

## 2025-10-12

- Applied time-sync offsets to command scheduling so sync flashes and start/stop commands line up with the orchestrator clock
- Documented the updated sync behaviour for the current repository snapshot
- Wired audio, RGB, and thermal connectors to stamp recordings with orchestrator-aligned metadata so analysis inherits consistent timelines

## 2025-10-13

- Introduced multi-device connector managers for Shimmer and Topdon using the hardware inventory asset and in-memory settings per device
- Refactored the sensor repository and Topdon device repository to stream multiple endpoints simultaneously with per-device preview control
- Documented the new `device-inventory.json` workflow and queued follow-ups for UI surfacing and automated inventory backfill

## 2025-10-13

- Sanitised desktop and Android UI copy to stay ASCII-safe across the Compose stacks
- Refreshed README/backlog to capture the completed desktop console, sync pipeline, calibration tooling, and post-session transfer flow

## 2025-10-13

- Added hardware inventory Compose section with per-device status, active Topdon selection, and persisted updates back into the configuration repository
- Implemented multi-device recording exercise runner + UI card, capturing per-device stream verification and surfaced results in the dashboard

## 2025-10-13

- Split orchestration logic into application services (recording, device commands, time sync) and updated Hilt modules plus consumers

## 2025-10-13

- Harmonized and simplified all Gradle build files in external/Shimmer repositories
- Standardized to Gradle 8.5, Java 11, modern plugin syntax across 37 files
- Removed deprecated configurations (jcenter, dexOptions, eclipse plugin, compile/testCompile)
- Updated all example apps to consistent configuration pattern
- Cleaned settings.gradle files to remove non-existent module references

## 2025-10-13

- Removed all comments from XML, Java, and Kotlin files in external/topdon directories
- Processed 333 files removing 54,983 bytes of comments (Java: 193 files, Kotlin: 7 files, XML: 31 files, modules: 102 files)
- Preserved string literals and code structure while ensuring ASCII-safe character compliance

## 2025-10-13

- Conducted comprehensive repository analysis documenting gaps and unfinished work
- Created GAPS_AND_UNFINISHED.md with detailed status of all functional and non-functional requirements
- Identified critical blockers: desktop orchestrator ~50% complete, zero integration tests, time sync unvalidated
- Documented 18 major gap areas with prioritized 14-20 week roadmap for completion
- Staged control networking foundations: control.proto, ControlServer skeleton, token issuance/interceptor, and mDNS advertiser/browser
- Extended README/backlog with the new control-service roadmap and captured follow-ups for heartbeat wiring and sync telemetry UI

## 2025-10-13

- Started the on-device ControlServer from DeviceCommandService, merged local command traffic with orchestrator subscriptions, and exposed token issuance via `issueLocalToken`
- Added BuildConfig-driven control port, fed local commands through existing flows, and updated docs/backlog for the next integration tasks

## 2025-10-13

- Added recording manifest writer plus consistent artifact naming and wired `DefaultRecordingService` to persist session metadata
- Introduced `SpaceMonitor`, retention preferences repository, WorkManager-powered Upload/Retention workers, and a settings screen to apply orchestrator/retention policy
- Replaced `SessionClock` with `TimeModelAdapter`, normalised Topdon thermal frames, and surfaced live telemetry (streams, uploads, events, storage) via the new Live Session screen
- Implemented session library and manifest detail views backed by the stored manifests and refreshed README/backlog to reflect the new UI and background services

## 2025-10-13

- Replaced the RGB MediaRecorder path with a MediaCodec + MediaMuxer pipeline that writes crash-safe MediaStore segments, tracks encoder stats, and enqueues artifacts with per-segment metadata
- Added bookmark repository/UI wiring so operators can drop timeline markers during capture and see them in session detail views
- Refreshed Live Session, Settings, and manifest screens to surface encoder telemetry, bookmark lists, and cleaner state flows; updated README/backlog to capture the new recording workflow

## 2025-10-14

- Instrumented upload recovery logging (WorkManager retries -> UI + `upload_recovery.jsonl`) and noted follow-up to simulate mid-transfer drops
- Documented the offline recovery dry-run in `docs/manual-tests/offline-recovery.md` so field teams can force disconnects, capture retries, and archive JSONL/WorkManager evidence
- Swapped calibration card for the guided wizard with confidence metrics persisted via DataStore and wrote the operator walkthrough in `docs/manual-tests/calibration-wizard.md`
- Started capturing CPU/memory/storage telemetry per session into `performance_metrics.jsonl` to prep for 8+ device stress runs
- Added backlog overflow guardrails (warning/critical thresholds, UI card, drop-newest policy) and recorded behaviour for manual review during soak tests
- Authored `tools/perf/multi_device_stress.sh` + `tools/perf/analyze_metrics.py` with `docs/manual-tests/multi-device-stress.md` to script coordinated 8+ device stress rehearsals and capture performance summaries
- Brought in `BacklogTelemetryLogger` and `tools/tests/offline_recovery.sh` to automate reconnection drills and persist backlog snapshots alongside each session
- Introduced adaptive capture throttling via `BacklogPerformanceController` and exposed throttle state in Live Session
- Added `PerformanceMetricsAnalyzer` to emit `performance_summary.json` for every session, powering automated trending of CPU/memory/storage data
- Taught the creeping build script to export `JAVA_HOME`/`org.gradle.java.home`, leaving Windows users to set `%USERPROFILE%\.gradle\gradle.properties` when needed
- Noted in docs that Android build-tools 35.0.0 must be installed; Gradle reports a missing `aapt` otherwise (seen on WSL-hosted SDK)

## 2025-10-13

- Conducted comprehensive technical debt analysis covering implementation gaps, architectural issues, and code quality
- Created TECHNICAL_DEBT_ANALYSIS_2025-10-13.md documenting critical blockers (desktop 50% complete, 4% test coverage, time sync unvalidated)
- Created CODE_QUALITY_ANALYSIS_2025-10-13.md with deep dive into code complexity, error handling, concurrency, and quality metrics

- Prioritized remediation roadmap: Phase 1 (4-6 weeks) covers desktop completion, integration tests, and time sync validation
- Updated BACKLOG with critical priorities and cross-references to detailed analysis documents

## 2025-10-13

- Updated all agent instruction files (AGENTS.md, GEMINI.md, .github/copilot-instructions.md) with file naming and tracking standards
- All documentation files now require date in filename (e.g., FILENAME_YYYY-MM-DD.md) and header with modification timestamp and agent name
- Established version control policy: create new dated files rather than modifying old ones for historical tracking
- Enabled all agents to read, modify, and create Markdown files by updating File Permissions sections in all agent instruction files
- Removed previous File Exclusions that prohibited MD file generation
- Explicitly encouraged documentation generation following naming standards

## 2025-10-13
